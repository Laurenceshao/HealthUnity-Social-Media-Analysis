code performs the following tasks:**\n","1.   Import required libraries: pandas and matplotlib.pyplot are imported for data manipulation and plotting, respectively.\n","2.   Load the eight CSV files: Four CSV files containing the count of unique word pairs for different age groups with n > 1 (df1, df2, df3, df4) and four CSV files containing the total number of word pairs for each age group (file1, file2, file3, file4) are read into separate DataFrames.\n","3.   Calculate the number of rows in each file: The number of rows in file1, file2, file3, and file4 are calculated and stored in file1_rows, file2_rows, file3_rows, and file4_rows, respectively.\n","4.   Merge DataFrames: The four DataFrames (df1, df2, df3, and df4) are merged based on the 'word1' and 'word2' columns, creating a new DataFrame called merged_df. The 'n' column for each DataFrame is renamed to 'n_1', 'n_2', 'n_3', and 'n_4' during the merging process to avoid confusion.\n","5.   Fill NaN values: Any NaN values in the merged_df DataFrame are replaced with 0.\n","6.   Get unique combinations of 'word1' and 'word2': The unique combinations of 'word1' and 'word2' are extracted from the merged_df DataFrame and stored in a new DataFrame called unique_pairs.\n","7.   Create a new DataFrame to store the values for each group: A new DataFrame called grouped_df is created to store the combined word pairs (word1 + word2), and their corresponding counts (n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4) for each age group.\n","8.   Iterate through unique_pairs: For each unique pair of words in unique_pairs, the corresponding counts for each age group are extracted from the merged_df DataFrame and appended as a new row to the grouped_df DataFrame.\n","9.   Create a grouped bar chart: A grouped bar chart is created using the data in the grouped_df DataFrame. The bar chart displays the ratio of counts for each unique word pair in the four age groups (<=18, 19-29, 30-39, and >=40). The bars are displayed in different colors for each age group, and labels are provided for easier identification.\n","10.   Customize the x-axis labels: The x-axis labels are set to the combined word pairs (word1 + word2), rotated at a 45-degree angle for better readability.\n","11.
